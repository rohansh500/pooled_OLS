pooled OLS to estimate a model with a the dependent variable

Task - 

Use GPA3 data for this exercise (attached excel file and data description file). The data
set is for 366 student-athletes from a large university for the fall and spring semesters.
Because you have two terms of data for each student, an unobserved effects model is
appropriate. The primary question of interest is this: Do athletes perform more poorly in
school during the semester their sport is in season?
a. Use pooled OLS to estimate a model with the term GPA (trmgpa) as the
dependent variable. The explanatory variables are spring, sat, hsperc, female,
black, white, frstsem, tothrs, crsgpa, and season. Interpret the coefficient on the
season. Is it statistically significant?
b. Most of the athletes who play their sport only in the fall are football players.
Suppose the ability levels of football players differ systematically from those of
other athletes. If ability is not adequately captured by SAT score and high school
percentile, explain why the pooled OLS estimators will be biased.
c. Now, use the data differenced across the two terms. Which variables drop out?
Now, test for an in-season effect.
d. Can you think of one or more potentially important, time-varying variables that
have been omitted from the analysis?
